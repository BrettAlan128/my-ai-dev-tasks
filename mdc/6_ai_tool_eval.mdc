Stage 6: AI-Tool Evaluation

1. Stage Overview

Goal: Shortlist AI tools/models to fill capability gaps with confidence ratings.

Inputs (from PM):

Gaps (Epics or capabilities needing AI)

Evaluation Axes (criteria for scoring)

Optional researchFile containing deep research insights

suggestConfidence flag

2. Deep Research Offer (Optional)

If you haven’t yet, run a focused deep research to populate candidates and confidence scores:

## Deep Research: AI Model & Tool Landscape

**Model Selection (choose one):**
- ChatGPT UI (paste this block into ChatGPT → GPT-4/4o)
- Gemini API (send via your Vertex AI endpoint)

**Objective:** Identify and evaluate AI tools/models for our specified gaps.

**Instructions:**
1. List 5–7 AI tools/models relevant to each gap.
2. For each, capture:
   - **Tool/Model**
   - **Core Capability**
   - **Latest Major Release Date**
   - **Pricing Model**
   - **Integration Method** (API/SDK/CLI)
   - **Community Feedback or Case Study**
   - **Confidence (0–100%)**: How suitable is this tool based on available info?

**Deliverable Format:**
- Table: Tool/Model → Capability → Release Date → Pricing → Integration → Confidence → Notes
- 2–3 bullet insights on top picks

Merge your research into research/stage-6.md and reference it below.
